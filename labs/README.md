# Labs

This course make an intensive use of *Python notebooks* with Python 3.3 or greater.

In order to use Python on your computer, we propose to download the distribution called Anaconda. In
particular, [Miniconda](http://conda.pydata.org/miniconda.html) which contains only Python and the
conda package manager. This distribution enables to work with different release of Python (2.7 and
3.5). It also includes IPython which enables interactive computing. Download Miniconda (Python 3.5)
for your specific operating system and install it. Go to the 30-minute test drive
(http://conda.pydata.org/docs/test-drive.html) to understand how (Ana)conda manages the programming
environments. We recommend you to save and print the Conda user cheat sheet conda-cheatsheet.pdf.

Create a specific environment (for instance datascience) with the Python package jupyter (see,
[http://jupyter.readthedocs.io/en/latest/install.html](http://jupyter.readthedocs.io/en/latest/install.html)).

Once all the packages are installed, run the notebook An-introduction-to-Python.ipynb with jupyter (see, [Running the Notebook](http://jupyter.readthedocs.io/en/latest/running.html#running)). Click on the menu *Help -> User Interface Tour* for an overview of the user interface.
